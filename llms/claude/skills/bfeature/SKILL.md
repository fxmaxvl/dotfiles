Orchestrate the full development workflow for a feature. Manage state via `.claude/.bfeature-temp/build-state.json` and delegate to existing skills with approval gates between each phase.

## Artifacts Directory

All build artifacts (spec, plan, todo, backlog, build-state.json) live in `<project_root>/.claude/.bfeature-temp/`. `project_root` is always the **git repository root** — resolved via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` (NOT the current working directory, NOT a package subdirectory, NOT `~/.claude/`). The directory is created via `mkdir -p` during init and the state file is removed at the end of finalization.

## Sub-skill Resolution

Sub-skills are **not registered** with the Skill tool and cannot be invoked via `Skill(name)`. Always locate them by reading their SKILL.md directly.

**Reading the sub-skill's SKILL.md is mandatory before executing that phase.** Never skip this step and proceed directly to writing code or running commands. The sub-skill files contain the authoritative instructions for each phase — ignoring them causes missed quality gates, wrong outputs, and broken flows.

To find a sub-skill's SKILL.md, use: `Glob("~/.claude/skills/bfeature/**/SKILL.md")` — then match by the path column in the routing table below. If the Glob returns no results, try `Glob("skills/bfeature/**/SKILL.md")` (some setups use a local `skills/` directory).

**Invocation patterns:**

- **Inline** (user interaction required): Read the SKILL.md at the listed path, then follow its instructions directly in the current conversation. Do **not** use the Skill tool or Agent tool.
- **Agent**: Read the SKILL.md at the listed path, then pass its full contents as the agent's `prompt`. Always pass the declared model.

## Model Routing

Each sub-skill declares a `model` field in its SKILL.md frontmatter. When delegating to a sub-skill via the Agent tool, **always pass the declared model**. The current routing:

| Sub-skill | SKILL.md path | Invocation | Model | Rationale |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-------|-----------|
| brainstorm (gather) | `bfeature/brainstorm/SKILL.md` | Inline | — | Interactive Q&A — must stay in main conversation |
| brainstorm/generate | `bfeature/brainstorm/generate/SKILL.md` | Agent | opus | Spec synthesis from Q&A — reasoning-heavy, no interaction needed |
| refine | `bfeature/refine/SKILL.md` | Inline | — | Interactive Q&A — must stay in main conversation (quick mode only) |
| review-design | `bfeature/review-design/SKILL.md` | Agent | opus | Architectural analysis — produces report, no user interaction |
| review-design/fix | `bfeature/review-design/fix/SKILL.md` | Agent | sonnet | Applies spec fixes — execution task |
| plan | `bfeature/plan/SKILL.md` | Agent | opus | Deep reasoning for TDD blueprints |
| do-todo | `bfeature/do-todo/SKILL.md` | Agent | sonnet | Fast, execution-focused coding |
| verify | `bfeature/verify/SKILL.md` | Agent | sonnet | Quality gates — runs tests (monorepo-aware) and lint with auto-fix |
| review-impl | `bfeature/review-impl/SKILL.md` | Agent | opus | Implementation analysis — produces report, no user interaction |
| review-impl/fix | `bfeature/review-impl/fix/SKILL.md` | Agent | sonnet | Applies code fixes — execution task |
| collect-todos (Phase 7, optional) | `bfeature/collect-todos/SKILL.md` | Agent | sonnet | Mechanical scanning task — skipped if user declines |

**Phase 6 (Finalize) and Phase 8 (Cleanup) are executed directly by the orchestrator** — they have no sub-skill files. The finalize logic is defined inline in this file (see Phase 6 below).

## Status Banners

At the start of every phase, print a banner to the conversation so the user knows where they are. Use this exact format:

```
── bfeature | Name ───────────────────────────────
```

For example: `── bfeature | Plan ───────────────────────────────`

Print the banner as plain text (not in a code block). Do this before any other work in the phase.

## Phase Flow

**Full mode** (default):
```
init → brainstorm → [auto] review-design ⇄ fix → [auto] plan → [GATE] execute → [auto] verify → [auto] review-impl ⇄ fix → [auto] verify (silent) → [GATE: ready + todos?] finalize (commit/push/ticket) → collect-todos? → cleanup → done
```

**Quick mode** (invoked via `/bfeature --quick`):
```
init → refine → [auto] plan (from Q&A) → [GATE] execute → [auto] verify → [auto] review-impl ⇄ fix → [auto] verify (silent) → [GATE: ready + todos?] finalize (commit/push/ticket) → collect-todos? → cleanup → done
```

**Gates legend:**
- `[auto]` — proceeds without asking
- `[GATE]` — stops and waits for user approval
- `⇄ fix` — per-cycle "fix these concerns?" stop inside review loops

Quick mode skips **only** brainstorm and review-design. Every other phase — refine, plan, execute, verify, review-impl, verify (silent), finalize — is **mandatory** regardless of how simple or obvious the fix appears. Do not collapse, merge, or skip phases because the task looks trivial. The phases exist as quality gates that apply at all complexity levels.

## On Invocation

1. **Detect `--quick` flag:** Check if `$ARGUMENTS` starts with or contains `--quick`. If it does:
   - Set `quick_mode` to `true`
   - Strip `--quick` from `$ARGUMENTS` before using the remainder as the idea
2. **Resolve `project_root`:** Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. Store the result as `project_root`. All artifact paths below use this value.
3. Check if `<project_root>/.claude/.bfeature-temp/build-state.json` exists
4. If it does not exist: start from Phase 0 (init)
5. If it exists: run `bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh` to load state and resume:
   - If `phase_status` is `"awaiting_approval"`:
     - If `phase` is `"finalize"`: re-ask the pre-finalization gate (both questions: ready to finalize? + collect TODOs?). If not ready: exit. If ready: set `phase_status` to `"in_progress"`, save `collect_todos` answer, update state, continue Phase 6 from step 3 (skip silent verify — it already passed).
     - Otherwise: ask "Paused before [current phase]. Ready to proceed?" — if yes, set `phase_status` to `"in_progress"`, update state, execute the current phase; if no, exit
   - Otherwise: resume the current phase from where it left off

## Phase 0 — Init

Print banner: `── bfeature | Init ───────────────────────────────`

1. **Detect GitHub issue:** Check if `$ARGUMENTS` contains a `GH-ISSUE:<number>` marker. If it does:
   - Extract the issue number
   - Set `github_issue.enabled` to `true` and `github_issue.number` to the extracted number in state (see below)
   - Use the issue number as slug prefix: `gh-<number>-<short-description>` (e.g., `gh-12-token-refresh`)
2. **Detect Jira ticket:** Check if `$ARGUMENTS` contains a Jira ticket URL (e.g., `https://<domain>.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123` or similar). If it does:
   - Extract the ticket key (e.g., `PROJ-123`)
   - Invoke the `jira-issue` skill to verify Jira MCP tools are available. If not available, stop.
   - Set `jira.ticket_key` in state (see below)
   - Use the ticket key as slug prefix: `<ticket-key>-<short-description>` (e.g., `PROJ-123-dark-mode`)
   - Invoke the `jira-issue` skill: `transition-to(ticket_key, "In Progress")`
3. If neither GitHub issue nor Jira ticket: derive a short kebab-case slug from the idea as before (e.g., "add dark mode" → "dark-mode")
4. **Branch selection:**
   - Check the current git branch
   - If on `master` (or the repo's main branch): create and checkout `feat/<slug>` from master
   - If on a non-master branch (e.g., `feat/something`): ask the user — "You're currently on `<branch>`. Do you want to continue working here, or create a new branch `feat/<slug>` from master?"
     - If the user chooses to continue: stay on the current branch, use the current branch name to derive the slug (strip `feat/` prefix if present)
     - If the user chooses a new branch: create and checkout `feat/<slug>` from master

5. Initialize state. Build the argument list from what was detected above:

```
bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh --init \
  --slug "<slug>" \
  --idea "<idea>" \
  [--mode quick]                           # only if --quick flag was detected \
  [--jira-key PROJ-123 --jira-url <url>]   # only if Jira ticket detected \
  [--gh-issue 42]                          # only if GitHub issue detected
```

   The script creates `.claude/.bfeature-temp/build-state.json`, computes `build_timestamp` in `YYYYMMDDTHH` format, and outputs JSON with `slug`, `build_timestamp`, `mode`, `paths.*`, `jira`, and `github_issue` — use these values for the rest of the session instead of re-reading state.

6. Proceed to Phase 1 (brainstorm for full mode, refine for quick mode).

**Artifact naming convention:** All artifact filenames use the format `<build_timestamp>-<slug>-<artifact>.md`. The timestamp is captured once at init by `init-state.sh`, stored in state as `build_timestamp`, and reused for all artifact names. Use `paths.*` from `state-ops.sh` instead of constructing paths manually.

## Phase 1 — Brainstorm (full mode only)

Print banner: `── bfeature | Brainstorm ───────────────────────────────`

Skipped entirely in quick mode — quick mode uses Phase 1Q (Refine) instead.

### Resuming from `waiting_answer`
If state has `phase` = `"brainstorm"` and `phase_status` = `"waiting_answer"`:
1. Invoke the `jira` skill: `check-for-answers(jira.ticket_key, jira.pending_questions)`
2. If all questions are answered in Jira: clear `jira.pending_questions`, set `phase_status` to `"in_progress"`, and continue the brainstorm with the new answers
3. If some questions are still unanswered in Jira: show the user the pending questions and ask — "No answer on Jira yet for these. Do you have the answers yourself, or should we keep waiting?"
   - If the user provides answers: use them, clear `jira.pending_questions`, set `phase_status` to `"in_progress"`, and continue the brainstorm
   - If the user wants to keep waiting: remain in `waiting_answer`

### If `jira.enabled` is `true`:
1. Invoke the `jira` skill: `read-ticket(jira.ticket_key)` to fetch the ticket's description, comments, and context
2. Synthesize an overall description from the ticket content
3. Read `bfeature/brainstorm/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions **inline** (in the current conversation) with the synthesized description
   - Runs in the main conversation — user interaction is fully available
   - Gather saves Q&A to `.claude/.bfeature-temp/<build_timestamp>-<slug>-qa.md`
4. Read `bfeature/brainstorm/generate/SKILL.md` and pass its contents as an Agent prompt (model: opus) to produce the spec from the Q&A

### If `jira.enabled` is `false`:
1. Read `bfeature/brainstorm/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions **inline** (in the current conversation) with the idea from state
   - Runs in the main conversation — user interaction is fully available
   - Gather saves Q&A to `.claude/.bfeature-temp/<build_timestamp>-<slug>-qa.md`
2. Read `bfeature/brainstorm/generate/SKILL.md` and pass its contents as an Agent prompt (model: opus) to produce the spec from the Q&A

### Escalating questions to Jira
If during brainstorm the user cannot answer a clarifying question and asks to post it to Jira (`jira.enabled` must be `true`):
1. Invoke the `jira` skill: `ask-author(jira.ticket_key, questions)` — this tags the ticket author and posts the questions as a comment
2. Save the questions to `jira.pending_questions` in state
3. Set `phase_status` to `"waiting_answer"`
4. Tell the user: "Questions posted to Jira ticket. Run `/bfeature` again later to check for answers."

### In all cases:
When the file at `paths.spec` is detected:
   ```
   bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh \
     artifacts.spec="<build_timestamp>-<slug>-spec.md" \
     phase=review-design phase_status=in_progress
   ```
   Proceed immediately to Phase 2 (no approval gate)

## Phase 1Q — Refine (quick mode only)

Print banner: `── bfeature | Refine ───────────────────────────────`

Skipped entirely in full mode — full mode uses Phase 1 (Brainstorm) instead.

1. Read `bfeature/refine/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions **inline** (in the current conversation) with the idea from state
   - Runs in the main conversation — user interaction is fully available
   - Saves Q&A to `.claude/.bfeature-temp/<build_timestamp>-<slug>-qa.md`
2. When the file at `paths.qa` is detected:
   ```
   bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh phase=plan phase_status=in_progress
   ```
   Proceed immediately to Phase 3 (no approval gate)

## Phase 2 — Review Design (full mode only)

Print banner: `── bfeature | Review Design ───────────────────────────────`

Skipped entirely in quick mode.

Run up to 3 analyze → fix cycles:

1. Read `bfeature/review-design/SKILL.md` and pass its contents as an Agent prompt (model: opus)
2. Read `.claude/.bfeature-temp/<build_timestamp>-<slug>-design-report.md`
3. If `STATUS: PASS`: proceed to step 5
4. If `STATUS: CONCERN`:
   - Show the concerns to the user
   - Ask: "Should I fix these concerns?"
   - If yes: read `bfeature/review-design/fix/SKILL.md` and pass its contents as an Agent prompt (model: sonnet), then go back to step 1
   - If no (user accepts as-is): proceed to step 5
   - If this was already the 3rd cycle: tell the user "Max review cycles reached — please review the spec manually" and stop
5. ```
   bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh phase=plan phase_status=in_progress
   ```
6. Proceed immediately to Phase 3 (no approval gate)

## Phase 3 — Plan

Print banner: `── bfeature | Plan ───────────────────────────────`

1. Read `bfeature/plan/SKILL.md` and pass its contents as an Agent prompt (model: opus) — it reads the appropriate source based on `mode` and produces `.claude/.bfeature-temp/<build_timestamp>-<slug>-plan.md` + `.claude/.bfeature-temp/<build_timestamp>-<slug>-todo.md`
2. When both files are detected:
   ```
   bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh \
     artifacts.plan="<build_timestamp>-<slug>-plan.md" \
     artifacts.todo="<build_timestamp>-<slug>-todo.md" \
     phase=execute phase_status=awaiting_approval
   ```
   - Ask the user: "Plan written. Ready to start execution?"
   - If yes: `bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh phase_status=in_progress` — proceed to Phase 4
   - If no: **Exit** (re-invoke `/bfeature` when ready)

## Phase 4 — Execute

Print banner: `── bfeature | Execute ───────────────────────────────`

1. Read `bfeature/do-todo/SKILL.md` and pass its contents as an Agent prompt (model: sonnet) — it loops internally until all items are checked
2. When it completes:
   ```
   bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh phase=verify phase_status=in_progress
   ```
   Proceed immediately to Phase 4.5 (no approval gate)

## Phase 4.5 — Verify

Print banner: `── bfeature | Verify ───────────────────────────────`

1. Read `bfeature/verify/SKILL.md` and pass its contents as an Agent prompt (model: sonnet)
   - Detects project type, consults conventions, determines test and lint commands
   - Runs full test suite (monorepo-scoped if applicable) — fixes failures caused by our changes; surfaces unrelated failures to the user
   - Runs linter with auto-fix where available — fixes all remaining issues manually if needed
2. When tests and lint are green:
   ```
   bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh phase=review-impl phase_status=in_progress
   ```
   Proceed immediately to Phase 5 (no approval gate)

## Phase 5 — Review Implementation

Print banner: `── bfeature | Review Implementation ───────────────────────────────`

Run up to 3 analyze → fix cycles:

1. Read `bfeature/review-impl/SKILL.md` and pass its contents as an Agent prompt (model: opus)
2. Read `paths.impl_report`
3. If `STATUS: PASS`: proceed to step 5
4. If `STATUS: CONCERN`:
   - Show the concerns to the user
   - Ask: "Should I fix these concerns?"
   - If yes: read `bfeature/review-impl/fix/SKILL.md` and pass its contents as an Agent prompt (model: sonnet), then go back to step 1
   - If no (user accepts as-is): proceed to step 5
   - If this was already the 3rd cycle: tell the user "Max review cycles reached — please review the implementation manually" and stop
5. ```
   bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh phase=finalize phase_status=in_progress
   ```
6. Proceed immediately to Phase 6 (no approval gate here — the combined gate is inside Phase 6)

## Phase 6 — Finalize

Print banner: `── bfeature | Finalize ───────────────────────────────`

1. **Silent quality gate:** Before touching git, read `bfeature/verify/SKILL.md` and pass its contents as an Agent prompt (model: sonnet) one final time.
   - This catches any regressions introduced by review-impl fix cycles
   - If tests or lint fail: stop, tell the user which checks failed, and ask how to proceed — do **not** commit broken code
   - If all green: continue
2. **Pre-finalization gate:** Run:
   ```
   bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh phase_status=awaiting_approval
   ```
   Then ask the user two questions:
   - "Ready to finalize (commit, push, PR)?"
   - "Should I scan for TODO comments and collect them to the backlog after?"
   - Wait for both answers before continuing. If not ready to finalize: **Exit** (re-invoke `/bfeature` when ready). Save the TODO answer in state as `collect_todos: true/false` so it survives session interruptions.
   - If ready: `bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh phase_status=in_progress collect_todos=<true|false>` — continue.
3. Check for uncommitted changes (verify and review-impl/fix cycles may have left changes unstaged). If any exist: stage them (do **not** `git add` anything in `.claude/.bfeature-temp/`) and commit following `conventions/git.md`:
   - Use `feat:` prefix with a concise description of the fixes/cleanup
   - If `github_issue.enabled`, include the issue number (e.g., `feat(#12): address review concerns`)
   - If `jira.enabled`, include the ticket key (e.g., `feat(PROJ-123): address review concerns`)
4. Push the branch to remote
5. Create a PR using `gh pr create`:
   - **PR body:** Read `paths.spec` and write a short summary (2–3 sentences max) of what the feature does and why — no test descriptions, no minor change lists, no implementation details
   - **If `github_issue.enabled` is `true`:** append `Closes #<github_issue.number>` to the PR body. This automatically closes the issue when the PR is merged.
   - **If `jira.enabled` is `true`:** append a link to the Jira ticket (`jira.ticket_url`) in the PR body
6. **If `jira.enabled` is `true`:**
   - Invoke the `jira-issue` skill: `transition-to(jira.ticket_key, "To Review")`
   - Invoke the `jira-issue` skill: `add-comment(jira.ticket_key, "PR: <pr_url>")`
7. Tell the user: "PR is up at <pr_url>. Build complete!"
8. ```
   bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh phase=collect-todos phase_status=in_progress
   ```
9. If `collect_todos` is `true` (set at the pre-finalization gate): proceed to Phase 7. Otherwise: skip Phase 7, proceed directly to Phase 8 (Cleanup)

## Phase 7 — Collect TODOs (optional)

Print banner: `── bfeature | Collect TODOs ───────────────────────────────`

1. Read `bfeature/collect-todos/SKILL.md` and pass its contents as an Agent prompt (model: sonnet)
2. The skill scans changes introduced by the feature branch for TODO comments, classifies them, and generates `.claude/.bfeature-temp/<build_timestamp>-<slug>-backlog.md`
3. When complete:
   ```
   bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh artifacts.backlog="<build_timestamp>-<slug>-backlog.md"
   # or if no items found:
   bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh artifacts.backlog=null
   ```
4. Proceed to Phase 8 (Cleanup)

## Phase 8 — Cleanup

Print banner: `── bfeature | Cleanup ───────────────────────────────`

```
bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/cleanup.sh
```

Deletes ephemeral handoff files (`qa.md`, `design-report.md`, `impl-report.md`) and `build-state.json`. Persistent artifacts (`spec`, `plan`, `todo`, `backlog`, `deployment`) are kept.

## State Updates

After every phase transition, use the helper script instead of reading/writing JSON manually:

```
bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh phase=<phase> phase_status=<status>
```

The script auto-sets `updated_at`. Use dot notation for nested fields:

```
bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh artifacts.plan=20260409T14-dark-mode-plan.md
bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh collect_todos=true
bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh phase=execute phase_status=awaiting_approval
```

Multiple key=value pairs can be passed in a single call. Boolean values (`true`/`false`) and `null` are written as JSON primitives automatically.

## Error Recovery

- If the session ends mid-phase, the next `/bfeature` invocation reads `.claude/.bfeature-temp/build-state.json` and resumes
- If the branch `feat/<slug>` already exists, switch to it instead of creating a new one
- If state shows phase `done`, tell the user the build is already complete

Here is the idea:
