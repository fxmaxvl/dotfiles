Run the helper script to load state and artifact paths:

```
bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh
```

This gives you `paths.design_report` and `paths.spec`.

Read the file at `paths.design_report` for the list of concerns.
Read the file at `paths.spec` for the current spec.

Update the file at `paths.spec` in place to address every concern listed in the report.

Do **not** re-run the review and do **not** ask the user questions — the orchestrator handles both.
