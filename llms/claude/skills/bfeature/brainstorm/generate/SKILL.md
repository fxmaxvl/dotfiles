Generate a complete, implementation-ready feature specification from the gathered requirements.

## Input

Run the helper script to load state and artifact paths:

```
bash ~/.claude/skills/bfeature/scripts/state-ops.sh
```

This gives you `slug`, `build_timestamp`, `mode`, and `paths.*`.

Read the file at `paths.qa` for the Q&A gathered interactively.

## Step 0 — Explore all layers named in the Q&A

Before writing anything, scan the Q&A for any named layers, packages, services, files, or components — especially sections like "Layers Requiring Changes", "Affected Packages", or similar. For each one mentioned:

1. Find the actual directory or file in the codebase (use Glob/Grep)
2. Read enough of its structure to understand its types, interfaces, and boundaries (domain types, converters, facades, proto definitions, etc.)
3. Note any layers named in the Q&A that you could **not** find — flag them explicitly in the spec under Implementation Notes

This step exists to prevent the spec from omitting layers that were identified in Q&A but not explored. A layer that appears in Q&A under "what needs to change" **must** appear in the spec's implementation notes.

## Output

Write a thorough spec to the path at `paths.spec`. Include:

- **Overview** — what this feature does and why
- **Goals** — what success looks like
- **Functional requirements** — what the system must do
- **Non-functional requirements** — performance, security, etc. (if applicable)
- **Out of scope** — explicit exclusions to prevent scope creep
- **Implementation notes** — key decisions, constraints, or considerations the planner should know

Do **not** commit or push the spec file.
